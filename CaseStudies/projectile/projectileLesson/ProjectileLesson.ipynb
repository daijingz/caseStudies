    "# Motion of a Projectile\n",
    "\n",
    "The free flight motion of a projectile is often studied in terms of its rectangular components in the $x-y$ plane, since the projectile's acceleration *always* acts in the vertical direction.  To illustrate the kinematic analysis, consider a projectile launched at point $(p_x^i, p_y^i)$ with the initial velocity $\\mathbf{v}^i$ having components $v_x^i$ and $v_y^i$, as shown in Figure [hyperref here?].  The position vector $\\mathbf{p}$ changes over time.  At any instant of time $t$ the position is represented by the components $p_x$ and $p_y$. When we assume that air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the projectile is its weight, which causes the projectile to have a *constant downward acceleration* of approximately $a = a_y = -g = -9.81 \\text{m}/\\text{s}^2$ or $g = 32.2 \\text{ft}/\\text{s}^2$.[^1] [footnotes don't seem to be working on my Mac?]\n",

    "## Procedure for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Free-flight projectile motion problems can be solved using the following procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Coordinate System\n",
    "\n",
    "- Establish the fixed $x$, $y$ coordinate axes and sketch the trajectory of the particle.  Between any *two points* on the path specify the given problem data and the *three unknowns*.  In all cases the acceleration of gravity acts downward.  The particle's initial and final velocities should be represented in terms of their $x$ and $y$ components.\n",
    "- Remember that positive and negative position, velocity, and acceleration components always act in accordance with their associated coordinate directions.\n",
    "- The two points that are selected should be significant points where something about the motion of the particle is known.  Potential significant points include the initial point of launching the projectile and the final point where it lands. The landing point often has a known $y$ value.\n",
    "- The variables in the equation may need to be changed to match the notation of the specific problem.  For instance, a distinction may need to be made between the $x$-coordinate of points $A$ and $B$, via notation like $p_x^A$ and $p_x^B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Identify Knowns\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the notation for the problem in question, write out the known variables and their values. The known variables will be a subset of the following: $p^i_x, p_x, p^i_y, p_y, v^i_x, v_x, v^i_y, v_y$ and $t$. The knowns should be written in the notation adopted for the particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Identify Unknowns\n",
    "\n",
    "Each problem will have at most 4 unknowns that need to be determined, selected from the variables listed in the Step 2 that are not known.  The number of relevant unknowns will usually be less than 4, since questions will often focus on one or two unknowns.  As an example, the equation that horizontal velocity is constant is so trivial that most problems will not look for this as an unknown.  The unknowns should be written in the notation adopted for the particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Kinematic Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depending upon the known data and what is to be determined, a choice should be made as to which four of the following five equations should be applied between the two points on the path to obtain the most direct solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4.1: Horizontal Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "From Equation [Eq_horizVel](#mjx-eqn-Eq_horizVel): $v_x = v_x^i$ (The *velocity* in the horizontal or $x$ direction is *constant*)\n",
    "\n",
    "From Equation [Eq_horizPos](#mjx-eqn-Eq_horizPos): $p_x = p_x^i + v_x^i t$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4.2: Vertical Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "In the vertical or $y$ direction *only two* of the following three equations (using $a_y = -g$) can be used for solution.  (The sign of $g$ will change to positive if the positive $y$ axis is downward.)\n",
    "\n",
    "From Equation [Eq_vertVel](#mjx-eqn-Eq_vertVel): $v_y = v_y^i - g t$\n",
    "\n",
    "From Equation [Eq_vertPos](#mjx-eqn-Eq_vertPos): $p_y = p_y^i + v_y^i t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2$\n",
    "\n",
    "From Equation [Eq_vertNoTime](#mjx-eqn-Eq_vertNoTime): $v_y^2 = (v_y^i)^2 - 2 g ( p_y - p_y^i)$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the particle's final velocity $v_y$ is not needed, then the first and third of these questions (for $y$) will not be useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Solve for Unknowns\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the equations from Step 4, together with the known values from Step 2 to find the unknown values from Step 3.  We can do this systematically by going through each equation and determining how many unknowns are in that equation.  Any equations with one unknown can be used to solve for that unknown directly."
