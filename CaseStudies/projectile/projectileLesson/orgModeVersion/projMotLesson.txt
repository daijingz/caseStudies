1 Learning Objectives
=====================

  - Derive kinematic equations for 2D projectile motion from kinematic
    equations from 1D rectilinear motion
  - Identify the assumptions required for the projectile motion
    equations to hold:
  - Air resistance is neglected
    - Gravitational acceleration acts downward and is constant,
      regardless of altitude
  - Solve any given (well-defined) free-flight projectile motion
    problems by:
    - Able to select an appropriate Cartesian coordinate system to
      simplify the problem as much as possible
    - Able to identify the known variables
    - Able to identify the unknown variables
    - Able to write projectile motion equations for the given problem
    - Able to solve the projectile motion equations for the unknown
      quantities


2 Rectilinear Kinematics: Continuous Motion (Recap)
===================================================

  As covered previously, the equations relating velocity ($v$), position
  ($p$) and time ($t$) for motion in one dimension with constant
  acceleration ($a$) are as follows:

  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_rectVel}
  v = v^i + a t
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_rectPos}
  p = p^i + v^i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
  \end{equation}

  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_rectNoTime}
  v^2 = (v^i)^2 + 2 a (p - p^i)
  \end{equation}

  where $v^i$ and $p^i$ are the initial velocity and position,
  respectively.

  Only two of these equations are independent, since the third equation
  can always be derived from the other two.


3 Motion of a Projectile
========================

  The free flight motion of a projectile is often studied in terms of
  its rectangular components in the $x-y$ plane, since the projectile's
  acceleration *always* acts in the vertical direction.  To illustrate
  the kinematic analysis, consider a projectile launched at point
  $(p_x^i, p_y^i)$ with the initial velocity $\mathbf{v}^i$ having
  components $v_x^i$ and $v_y^i$, as shown in Figure 1.  The position
  vector $\mathbf{p}$ changes over time.  At any instant of time $t$ the
  position is represented by the components $p_x$ and $p_y$. When we
  assume that air resistance is neglected, the only force acting on the
  projectile is its weight, which causes the projectile to have a
  *constant downward acceleration* of approximately $a = a_y = -g =
  -9.81 \text{m}/\text{s}^2$ or $g = 32.2 \text{ft}/\text{s}^2$.[1]

  The equations for rectilinear kinematics given above (Equations
  \ref{Eq_rectVel}, \ref{Eq_rectPos} and \ref{Eq_rectNoTime}) are in one
  dimension.  These equations can be applied for both the vertical
  motion and the horizontal directions, as follows:


3.1 Horizontal Motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  For projectile motion the acceleration in the horizontal direction is
  constant and equal to zero ($a_x = 0$).  This value can be substituted
  in the equations for constant acceleration given above to yield the
  following:

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectVel}:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_horizVel}
  v_x = v_x^i
  \end{equation}

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectPos}:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_horizPos}
  p_x = p_x^i + v_x^i
  \end{equation}

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectNoTime}:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{Eq_horizNoTime}
  v_x = v_x^i
  \end{equation}

  Since the acceleration in the $x$ direction ($a_x$) is zero, the
  horizontal component of velocity always remains constant during
  motion.


3.2 Vertical Motion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Since the positive $y$ axis is directed upward, the acceleration in
  the vertical direction is $a_y = -g$.  This value can be substituted
  in the equations for constant acceleration given above to yield the
  following:

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectVel}:
  \begin{equation}
  v_y = v_y^i - g t
  \label{Eq_vertVel}
  \end{equation}

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectPos}
  \begin{equation}
  p_y = p_y^i + v_y^i t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
  \label{Eq_vertPos}
  \end{equation}

  From Equation \ref{Eq_rectNoTime}:
  \begin{equation}
  v_y^2 = (v_y^i)^2 - 2 g ( p_y - p_y^i)
  \label{Eq_vertNoTime}
  \end{equation}

  Recall that the last equation can be formulated on the basis of
  eliminating the time $t$ between the first two equations , and
  therefore *only two of the above three equations are independent of
  one another*.


3.3 Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~

  In addition to knowing that the horizontal component of velocity is
  constant, problems involving the motion of a projectile can have at
  most three unknowns since only three independent equations can be
  written: that is, *one* equation in the *horizontal direction* and
  *two* in the *vertical direction*.  Once $v_x$ and $v_y$ are obtained,
  the resultant velocity $\mathbf{v}$, which is *always tangent* to the
  path, is defined by the *vector sum* as shown in Figure 1.


3.4 Procedure for Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Free-flight projectile motion problems can be solved using the
  following procedure.


3.4.1 Step 1: Coordinate System
-------------------------------

  - Establish the fixed $x$, $y$ coordinate axes and sketch the
    trajectory of the particle.  Between any *two points* on the path
    specify the given problem data and the *three unknowns*.  In all
    cases the acceleration of gravity acts downward.  The particle's
    initial and final velocities should be represented in terms of their
    $x$ and $y$ components.

  - Remember that positive and negative position, velocity, and
    acceleration components always act in accordance with their
    associated coordinate directions.

  - The two points that are selected should be significant points where
    something about the motion of the particle is known.  Potential
    significant points include the initial point of launching the
    projectile and the final point where it lands. The landing point
    often has a known $y$ value.

  - The variables in the equation may need to be changed to match the
    notation of the specific problem.  For instance, a distinction may
    need to be made between the $x$-coordinate of points $A$ and $B$,
    via notation like $p_x^A$ and $p_x^B$.
