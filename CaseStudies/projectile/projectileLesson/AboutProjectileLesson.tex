\title{Discussion of Projectile Lesson: What and Why}
\author{Spencer Smith}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

I've adapted Section 12.6 on Motion of a Projectile from the classic Hibbler
text ``Engineering Mechanics Dynamnics, 10th edition.''  I selected this topic
because it is one of the first topics typically taught when students are
introduced to the study of dynamics is projectile motion.  Projectile motion is
a good starting point for two reasons:

\begin{itemize}

\item The model developed is relatively simple because it only involves kinematic
quantities, not kinetics.  Kinematics focuses on the geometrics aspects of
motion, while kinetics introduces the concept of forces.  

\item Projectile motion has practical applications for tracking the motion of
launched or thrown objects.

\end{itemize}

To take into account that Section 12.6 builds on the
previous sections, I've added an initial section that simply provides a summary
of the equations that were previously derived.  The derivation of these
equations is fairly similar to how they are derived in the current Projectile
example in Drasil.  I've made an effort to change the symbols and notation to
match what is currently in Drasil.  

Comments have been incorporated into the text using square brackets [].

I've tried to write the parts using the simplest possible markdown.  Equations
are added using LaTeX.  To get cross-references to equations to work I had to
add the LaTeX extensions to my local installation of Jupyter.  Maybe there is a
better way to do cross-references?

For the code part, I tried to leave the variabilities in code (as opposed to in
the markdown), so that they can be changed easily.  The figure is ``hardcoded''
with specific values for the variable inputs.

For projectile motion, there are 5 equations (4 independent equations), but
Hibbler doesn't include the one about velocity in the horizontal direction being
constant in his list of 4 equations.  He mentions it, but doesn't consider it a
separate equation.

The general view of projecile problems has 10 variables: $p_x, p_y, v_x, v_y,
p_x^i, p_y^i, v_x^i, v_y^i, a, t$.  There are 4 independent equations (we don't
need the equation that eliminated time, since it is derived from the other
equations).  However, solving projectile motion problems isn't as simple as
solving for 4 unknowns from 4 equations, since the equations aren't all coupled.
For instance, if there are three unknowns of $p_x, v_x^i$ and $v_x$, there is no
way to solve for the unknowns, despite having 4 equations.  For completeness of
the presentation, it doesn't seem to be an option to exhaustively go through all
cases, since there are 10 choose 4, or 210 cases.  Some of the 210 aren't
solvable.  The textbooks tend to focus on problems inspired by real engineering
problems, so $a$ is usually set to g or 0.  Even in this case there are 9 choose
4, or 126 combinations.

The Drasil viewpoint of the family can be that everything up to the instance
model is mostly common to all examples.  The instance model selects the specific
equations, which are then rearranged to solve for the unknowns.

The kinematic equation where time has been eliminated is not used in the
Projectile SRS, because it isn't necessary.

Incorporating the results of the code into the markdown is possible by using the

\section {Discussion}

The Projectile example should be updated to use the modern approach to textbook
writing.  The knowledge should be classified and divided so that the generic
patterns emerge.  By classifying the knowledge, we'll be able to generalize to
other lessons.  This could also help us find the mapping between knowledge in
the SRS and knowledge in a typical lesson.

The elements of a textbook chapter have been categorized by the above resources.
The presentation in the resources provide an overview of the ``program family''
of textbooks.  The commonalities and variabilities are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Openers: Express ``subject, theme, aims, topics, and organization of a
  chapter [... readers should] know at the outset what they are reading and why
  or to what end'' (Lepionka 2003:117). E.g. if you follow Gagn√©'s nine events
  of instruction then you should include something to motivate and gain
  attention (step 1), something to help the frame and organize (step 2) and
  something to recall prior knowledge (step 3).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item overviews (previews)
  \item introductions
  \item outlines (text, bullets or graphics)
  \item focus questions (knowledge and comprehension questions)
  \item learning goals / objectives / outcomes / competences / skills
  \item A case problem
  \item In addition one may use the ``special features'' used inside chapters,
    e.g. vignettes, photos, quotations, ...
  \end{itemize}
\item Closers: Give students opportunities to review, reinforce, or extend their
  learning, i.e.\ help with transfer of learning (Lepionka 2003:118)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item conclusions and summaries (may include diagrams)
  \item list of definitions
  \item reference boxes (e.g. computer instructions)
  \item review questions
  \item self-assessment (usually simple quizzes)
  \item small exercises
  \item substantial exercises and problem cases
  \item fill-in tables (for "learning-in-action" books) to prepare a real world
    task
  \item ideas for projects (academic or real world)
  \item bibliographies and links (that can be annotated)
  \end{itemize}
\item Integrated Pedagogical Devices: These elements aid the learning process in
  several ways, e.g.\ by giving advice on how to understand / interpret or
  navigate, by engaging the learner in some reflection, by pointing out
  important elements, or to summarize key elements treated in previous text.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Emphasis (bold face) of words
  \item Marginalia that summarize paragraphs
  \item Lists that highlight main points
  \item Summary tables and graphics
  \item Cross-references that link backwards (or sometimes forwards) to important
    concepts
  \item Markers to identify embedded subjects (e.g. an ``external'' term used
    and that needs explanation)
  \item Study and review questions
  \item Pedagogical illustrations (concepts rendered graphically)
  \item Tips (to insure that the learner doesn't get caught in misconceptions or
    procedural errors)
  \item Reminders (e.g.\ make sure that something that was previously introduced
    is remembered)
  \end{itemize}
\item Interior Feature Strands: ``Intext features, whether boxes or portions of
  text set off through design, function pedagogically to attract attention;
  arouse curiosity; increase motivation to read; stimulate critical thinking; and
  provide opportunities for reflection, application, or problem solving''
  (Lepionka, 2003: 118).
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Case studies
  \item Problem descriptions
  \item Debates and reflections
  \item Profiles (case descriptions)
  \item Primary sources and data
  \item Models
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

To the last category of elements we could likely add ``historical notes, or
autobiographies of important figures''.  However, this may be covered under
``Profiles.''

If an entire book is treated as a sequence of Chapters, a tool like Drasil can
verify that all of the required sections are present and that the same sections
are used in each chapter.  There are textbook design principles in the links
above, like the principle that the format and structure of the textbook should
be obvious after reading the first chapter and that there won't be surprises in
later chapters.  These principles can be enforced by Drasil, or at least when
they are violated warnings could be provide.

The lists of elements for book chapters seem very complete, although I didn't
see any items corresponding to the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Pre-conditions - assumed prior knowledge for the lesson
\end{itemize}
